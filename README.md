# Autonomous-Robot

Project Description:
The Autonomous robot is a project I worked on consisting of three parts. 
1) Building the robot body/chassis
2) Wiring and connecting circuits to the Arduino board
3) Create a Pathfinding Algorithm that enables the robot to move

Focusing on part 3, it was important to be fully aware of what code enables which part of the robot to function. Understanding the robot's potential and limitation for movement is vital when writing a Pathfinder for the robot.

This algorithm was specifically made for the parts to our robot and were customized to its functionality. 

This project taught me how code can be used to connect multiple functioning parts and condense it to an Arduino board. With my code I was able to connect the motors to work with the sensors to work with a LiDAR sensor.
